# DONE: Eliminate Callback Collector and Fix DRAM Test

## Goal

Eliminate the `CallbackIntrinsicCollector` system and integrate callback generation directly into DRAM module generation, while fixing the DRAM test compilation issues. Additionally, change `has_mem_resp` and `get_mem_resp` from `Intrinsic` to `PureIntrinsic` as they are purely combinational operations without side effects.

## Implementation Summary

### Goal Achieved
Successfully eliminated the `CallbackIntrinsicCollector` system and integrated callback generation directly into DRAM module generation, while fixing the DRAM test compilation issues. Changed `has_mem_resp` and `get_mem_resp` from `Intrinsic` to `PureIntrinsic` as they are purely combinational operations without side effects.

### Action Items Completed
- ✅ **Document Development**: Updated design documents for inline callback generation and PureIntrinsic classification
- ✅ **PureIntrinsic Classification**: Changed has_mem_resp and get_mem_resp to PureIntrinsic classification
- ✅ **PureIntrinsic Code Generation**: Updated code generation for PureIntrinsic memory response operations
- ✅ **Vec<u8> Conversion**: Implemented Vec<u8> to BigUint conversion for memory responses
- ✅ **Callback Collector Elimination**: Eliminated CallbackIntrinsicCollector and integrated inline callback generation
- ✅ **DRAM Inline Callbacks**: Updated DRAM module generation with inline callback functions
- ✅ **DRAM Test Fix**: Fixed DRAM test to work with PureIntrinsic memory operations
- ✅ **Validation Testing**: Ran comprehensive test suite to validate changes (52 tests passed)
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Cleaned up unused callback collector code and imports

### Changes Made in the Codebase

#### Improvements Made
- **Architectural Simplification**: Eliminated the complex callback collection system that created unnecessary separation of concerns
- **Inline Callback Generation**: Each DRAM module now generates its own callback function in the same file, eliminating scope issues
- **Proper Intrinsic Classification**: Memory response operations are now correctly classified as PureIntrinsic since they are purely combinational
- **Vec<u8> to BigUint Conversion**: Implemented proper conversion using `BigUint::from_bytes_le` as documented

#### Interfaces Created
- **PURE_INTRIN_INFO**: New mapping for PureIntrinsic operations with simplified structure (no valued parameter needed)
- **Inline Callback Functions**: Each DRAM module now generates its own `callback_of_<dram_name>` function

#### Code Generation Changes
- **Simplified Module Generation**: Removed callback metadata collection phase
- **Direct Callback References**: Updated intrinsic codegen to use `crate::modules::{dram_name}::callback_of_{dram_name}` instead of global callback functions
- **BigUint Conversion**: `get_mem_resp` now returns `BigUint::from_bytes_le(&sim.{dram_name}_response.data)` instead of raw Vec<u8>

### Technical Decisions Made

#### PureIntrinsic Classification
- **Decision**: Moved `has_mem_resp` and `get_mem_resp` from `Intrinsic` to `PureIntrinsic`
- **Rationale**: These operations are purely combinational and don't have side effects, making them perfect candidates for PureIntrinsic
- **Impact**: Simplified the intrinsic system and made the semantic classification more accurate

#### Inline Callback Generation
- **Decision**: Generate callback functions directly in DRAM module files instead of collecting them in mod.rs
- **Rationale**: Eliminates scope issues and simplifies the code generation pipeline
- **Impact**: Each DRAM module is now self-contained with its own callback function

#### Vec<u8> to BigUint Conversion
- **Decision**: Use `BigUint::from_bytes_le` for converting memory response data
- **Rationale**: Follows the documented approach in intrinsic.md and provides proper integer conversion
- **Impact**: Fixes compilation errors and enables proper display formatting

### Success Criteria Met
1. ✅ `test_dram.py` compiles successfully without errors
2. ✅ `test_dram.py` runs and passes all assertions
3. ✅ Callback functions are generated inline with DRAM modules
4. ✅ `has_mem_resp` and `get_mem_resp` are properly classified as PureIntrinsic
5. ✅ Vec<u8> to BigUint conversion works correctly
6. ✅ All existing tests continue to pass without regressions (52/52 tests passed)
7. ✅ `CallbackIntrinsicCollector` is completely eliminated
8. ✅ Code generation produces clean, correct Rust code

### Files Modified
- `python/assassyn/ir/expr/intrinsic.py`: Added PureIntrinsic classification for memory operations
- `python/assassyn/codegen/simulator/_expr/intrinsics.py`: Updated codegen for PureIntrinsic operations and Vec<u8> conversion
- `python/assassyn/codegen/simulator/modules.py`: Eliminated callback collector, added inline callback generation
- `python/assassyn/codegen/simulator/callback_collector.py`: **DELETED** - No longer needed

### Test Results
- **DRAM Test**: ✅ Compiles and runs successfully
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: ✅ 52/52 tests passed
- **No Regressions**: ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Summary

This TODO successfully addressed the architectural issues with the callback collector system and fixed the DRAM test compilation problems. The solution involved eliminating the separate callback collection phase, integrating callback generation directly into DRAM modules, properly classifying memory response operations as PureIntrinsic, and implementing correct Vec<u8> to BigUint conversion as documented in the intrinsic design document.

The implementation resulted in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with better separation of concerns and eliminated the scope issues that were causing compilation failures. All tests pass and no regressions were introduced.
