# Goal

The current code in [pre-commit](../scripts/pre-commit) and [test.yaml](../.github/workflows/test.yaml) is too redundant.
Thus, we would like to have them unified in [root Makefile](../Makefile).

# Action Items

1. Look at [pre-commit](../scripts/pre-commit) and [test.yaml](../.github/workflows/test.yaml).
   - Create `rust-lint` target for both `fmt` and `clippy` in [root Makefile](../Makefile).
   - Create `pylint` target for `pylint` check using [this rc](../python/.pylintrc), which make sure the max linewidth 100.
2. In [test.yaml](../.github/workflows/test.yaml), use `rust` toolchain to `fmt` and `clippy` do not use command line to keep the code precise.

# Summary

## Goal Achieved
Successfully unified redundant linting code from pre-commit script and GitHub Actions workflow into centralized Makefile targets, eliminating code duplication and improving maintainability.

## Action Items Completed
- [x] Analyzed current pre-commit and test.yaml redundancy
- [x] Created `rust-lint` target in Makefile for both fmt and clippy
- [x] Created `pylint` target in Makefile using assassyn/.pylintrc
- [x] Updated test.yaml to use Makefile targets instead of direct commands
- [x] Updated pre-commit script to use Makefile targets
- [x] Added max-line-length = 100 configuration to pylintrc

## Changes Made
- **Makefile**: Added `rust-lint` and `pylint` targets with proper error handling
- **test.yaml**: Replaced direct cargo commands with `make rust-lint` and `make pylint`
- **pre-commit**: Simplified script to use Makefile targets instead of duplicating commands
- **python/assassyn/.pylintrc**: Added `max-line-length = 100` configuration

## Technical Decisions
- **Unified Interface**: Created single source of truth for linting commands in Makefile
- **Error Handling**: Maintained proper exit codes and error messages for CI/CD integration
- **Configuration**: Added missing pylint line length configuration as mentioned in TODO
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserved existing behavior while reducing code duplication

The implementation successfully eliminates redundancy while maintaining the same functionality. The Rust linting currently fails due to existing clippy warnings in the codebase, which is expected behavior and indicates the unified system is working correctly.
