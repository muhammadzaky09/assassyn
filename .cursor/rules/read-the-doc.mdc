# Read the Document

If there is a `.md` file with the same prefix as the
source file in the same folder including but not limited to
`.py/.rs/.cpp/.cc`. This `.md` file is the design
document of this module.
Refer to this module to understand the implementation.

If there is a `README.md` within a folder, and there
is `mod.rs` or `__init__.py` in this folder, this
document not only documents the methods in `__init__.py`
but also describes the structure of this module.

When asked to modify a module, incorporate the descriptions
in the documents to see if there is any discrepency between
the document and the code. If so, it indicates an ongoing
development to implement.
