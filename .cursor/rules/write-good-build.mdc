# Write Good Build Infra

1. `Makefile` is better than a shell script for the purpose of build and initialize a project, because it:
   - is originally built for this.
   - automatically fails when a command returns non-zero.
   - automatically manages dependence based concurrency.
   - automatically return to the original folder of invocation.
2. Keep in mind that `source script.sh` in Makefile does not affect the host shell environment.
